# Framer Animations

I made a simple webpage with 3 sections. I used Framer motion to animate transitions when scrolling between the different sections. All the icons I used  are from react-icons which is a react library that you can install in your terminal.
After Frilli's lecture on animations I was curious about Lottie and wanted to see if I could incorporate that into my webpage. Turns out they
have a ton of free animations that are so simple to use! You install Lottie player in terminal, pick an animation you like, download the json and then use it like you would a component.
